Title:
Gauge-based Writing OS / SILENCE–MIRROR Architecture

Context:
- Writing method focused on "gauge" (pre-writing safety sample), not evaluation.
- Primary users: last-fixed / partial-last-fixed exploratory writers.
- Goal: prevent cognitive overload and structural collapse in long-form writing.

Confirmed Concepts:
- Gauge writing = safety device, not a work-in-progress.
- Gauge size: up to ~3000 chars, minimum not fixed.
- Gauge evaluates writer capacity, not story quality.
- Writer often fixes last 1/4 (or direction) unconsciously to reduce exploration load.

Architecture:
1) FACT layer
   - Explicit session facts only (time, chars, fixed scope, rewrite distance, discardable).
   - No evaluation language.

2) TRACE layer
   - Fragmentary notes of hesitation, holds, unspoken thoughts.
   - Written for human, but primarily read by AI.

3) SILENCE layer (AI-only)
   - Detects absence, distribution bias, load shape, rhythm patterns.
   - No interpretation of intent or psychology.
   - Must never be exposed to the author.

4) MIRROR output
   - Reflects only structures already touched by the author.
   - Categories strictly limited:
     * observed_patterns
     * tensions_detected
     * stable_zones
     * risk_indicators
   - No advice, no evaluation, no future-facing statements.

Aggregation Rules (AI-internal):
- Aggregate across 3–7 gauge logs.
- Produce internal constraints only (safe bands, effective fixed scope ranges).
- Expose only as design constraints during outer-shell phase.

Boundary Rules:
- SILENCE may detect, MIRROR may only reflect.
- No naming of intent, no psychological inference.
- No optimization suggestions at MIRROR stage.

Next Steps (Deferred):
- Define MIRROR phrasing granularity.
- Design outer-shell (long-form) output format.
- Test with real gauge logs.

Status:
- Cognitive load high.
- Intentional pause applied.
- Safe to resume later without loss.
